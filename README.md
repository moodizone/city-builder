# City Builder - Front-End Project

## Description

This project is a **City Builder** application that allows users to dynamically construct and customize houses. The application provides an interactive and intuitive user experience, enabling users to:

- Customize house attributes (color, number of floors, name).
- Manage houses (add, duplicate, remove).
- Display weather conditions (sun, rain, snow) with the current temperature.

The project is built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Query**, with a focus on scalability, performance, and maintainability. The application state is persisted using **localStorage**, and optional enhancements like animations, drag-and-drop functionality, and weather effects have been implemented to improve the user experience.

## Time Allocation Plan

Hereâ€™s how I allocated my time over the 7-day period to implement the core functionality and optional enhancements:

### **Day 1-2:**

- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialize the project with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Query.
  - Configure the development environment and necessary dependencies.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Implement the ability to add, remove, and duplicate houses.
  - Allow users to customize house attributes (color, number of floors, name).
  - Add a basic weather display with icons (sun, rain, snow).

### **Day 3:**

- **Day/Night Cycle:**
  - Implement a toggle to switch between day and night modes.
  - Adjust background colors and lighting effects based on the time of day.
- **Smooth Animations:**
  - Add subtle animations for house actions (e.g., fade-in, slide-in).
  - Animate weather icons (e.g., sun rays, falling snowflakes).

### **Day 4:**

- **Interactive Weather Effects:**
  - Add dynamic weather effects (e.g., falling snowflakes, raindrops).
  - Enhance the weather display with interactive elements.

### **Day 5:**

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**
  - Allow users to drag and drop houses to rearrange them on the screen.
  - Implement this feature using a library like `react-dnd` or `react-beautiful-dnd`.

### **Day 6:**

- **Save/Load City Layout:**
  - Implement the ability to save the current city layout to `localStorage`.
  - Allow users to load a previously saved layout.

### **Day 7:**

- **UI Polish and Testing:**
  - Refine the UI for a polished look and feel.
  - Add sound effects for actions like adding/removing houses or changing weather.
  - Perform final testing to ensure the application is bug-free and performs well.
